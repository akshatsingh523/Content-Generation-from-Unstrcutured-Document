The Company for which i worked as freelancer we together developed a comprehensive system to extract and generate various forms of content from unstructured documents, including PPT, DOC, and PDF files. This system was designed to handle text, tables, images, and graphs, producing short descriptions, long descriptions, voice-overs, and elevator pitches. By implementing advanced algorithms for content analysis and extraction, I enhanced the efficiency and accessibility of information retrieval, enabling users to obtain summarized and detailed content quickly. I created and deployed APIs using FastAPI for these outputs, ensuring seamless integration and live use. This solution is particularly beneficial for businesses, educational institutions, and content creators, as it streamlines content summarization and presentation, facilitating the repurposing and effective communication of key information.
